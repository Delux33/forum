# This is a simple forum with auto-bot to answer on comments

The bot's job is to read a book or a file with the text that we specify, and using a regular expression fills the database with phrases.

After that, randomly selects a phrase and responds to all unanswered comments.

The bot is configured to work every minute, and the database with phrases is updated every 10 minutes
